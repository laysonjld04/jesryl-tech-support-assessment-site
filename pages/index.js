        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Assessment Questions & Answers</h2>

        {/* Question Number 1 */}
        <p className="text-left">
          <strong>1. Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain one challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you overcame it.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          For this assessment, I used Next.js as my framework because it provides an efficient way to build static websites while allowing room for future scalability. 
          <br />
          Since Netlify is a powerful platform for hosting and deploying static sites, I chose it for its seamless integration and automation features.
          <br />
          Tools & Choices:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li><strong>Next.js</strong> ‚Üí Enables fast, SEO-friendly static site generation.</li>
          <li><strong>GitHub</strong> ‚Üí Used for version control and smooth integration with Netlify.</li>
          <li><strong>Netlify</strong> ‚Üí Manages automatic deployment, CI/CD workflows, and free hosting.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p className="text-left">
          Challenge & Solution:
          <br />
          One issue I encountered was SSH authentication for GitHub, as I initially faced a &quot;Permission denied (publickey) error&quot;. To fix this, I generated a new SSH key, added it to my GitHub account, and successfully established a secure connection.
        </p>


        {/* Question Number 2 */}
        <p className="text-left">
          <strong>2. What did you think of our service during the time you used it? Provide some constructive criticism or some features that impressed you.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          I was impressed by how effortlessly Netlify deploys projects from GitHub and hosts web applications.
          <br />
          At the moment, I don‚Äôt see any areas for improvement, but here are the features that stood out to me:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li><strong>Seamless GitHub Integration</strong> ‚Üí Automatic deployment from my GitHub repository made the process smooth.</li>
          <li><strong>CI/CD Workflow</strong> ‚Üí Every push to GitHub triggers an automatic build and deployment.</li>
          <li><strong>User-Friendly Dashboard</strong> ‚Üí Managing site settings, environment variables, and deployments is intuitive.</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Question Number 5 */}
        <p className="text-left">
          <strong>5. Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical customers hosting websites.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          One major challenge for less-technical users is understanding DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.). Many struggle to differentiate their functions‚Äîfor instance, an A record maps a domain to an IP address, while a CNAME record creates an alias for another domain. Without this knowledge, users may configure DNS settings incorrectly, leading to issues like inaccessible websites or email failures.
          <br />
          Another common challenge is DNS propagation delays. When users update DNS settings, such as pointing their domain to Netlify, changes don‚Äôt take effect immediately. Since DNS updates must propagate across multiple global servers, it can take hours to fully reflect. This delay often confuses users who expect instant changes, leading to frustration when their site doesn‚Äôt update as expected.

          <li><strong>Check for Missing Dependencies</strong> ‚Äì Confirm all required packages are installed by running npm install.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm Node.js Version</strong> ‚Äì Ensure the project is using a Node.js version compatible with Netlify‚Äôs environment.</li>

          Subject: Troubleshooting Your Build Failure on Netlify
          <br />
          Hi [Customer&apos;s Name],
          <br />
          I see that your build failed with Exit Code 2, which can happen due to various reasons, such as missing dependencies or incorrect build commands. 
          <br />
          To help troubleshoot, could you check the following?
        </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>The build command in your Netlify settings is set to npm run build.</li>
            <li>All dependencies are installed by running npm install.</li>
            <li>Your Node.js version matches Netlify‚Äôs environment.</li>
            <li>If possible, try running npm run build locally and share any errors you encounter.</li>
          </ul>
        <p className="text-left">
          Let me know what you find, and I‚Äôd be happy to assist further!
